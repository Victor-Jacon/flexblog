                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. 

                    Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. 
                    You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

                    No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. 
                    And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. 
                    It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.”

                    Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary</p>

                <p>Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
                    Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.</p>

                <h2> Smart</h2>
                <p> Back in the 1960s, when scientists stuck a bunch of geniuses in a house 
                    and observed them to try to figure out what qualities they all shared, 
                    they discovered that, from poets to entrepreneurs to scientists, 
                    every super achiever in the group 
                    was extremely open to new ideas and experiences.

            <div class="quality-item">
                <h2> Compact </h2>
                <p> Compact building design allows communities to be designed in a way 
                    that preserves more open space and 
                    makes more efficient use of land and resources
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quality-item">
                <h2> Economy </h2>
                <p> First and foremost, saving money is important because 
                    it helps protect you in the event of a financial emergency. 
                    Additionally, saving money can help you pay for large purchases, 
                    avoid debt, reduce your financial stress, leave a financial legacy, 
                    and provide you with a greater sense of financial freedom.

            <div class="quality-item">
                <h2> Transparent </h2>
                <p> Designers often use opacity to create a sense of depth in design 
                    by translating the effects of physical transparency into layers of line, 
                    shape, image, texture, and color to achieve a graphic transparency, 
                    with the intended outcome of making two or more surfaces or objects 
                    simultaneously visible.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quality-item">
                <h2> Sustainable </h2>
                <p> Sustainable design seeks to reduce negative impacts on the environment, 
                    and the health and comfort of building occupants, 
                    thereby improving building performance. 
                    The basic objectives of sustainability are 
                    to reduce consumption of non-renewable resources, minimize waste, 
                    and create healthy, productive environments.

            </div>

            <div class="quality-item">
                <h2> Opaque </h2>
                <p> Translucent objects allow some light to travel through them. 
                    Materials like frosted glass and some plastics are called translucent. 
                    When light strikes translucent materials, 
                    only some of the light passes through them
